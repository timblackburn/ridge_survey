- [ ] Identify if there is any remaining scrollbar decoration and pseudo-scrollbar decoration.  I may ask you to remove any of those, but I want to understand if there is any remaining code/css for this first before you do anything.
- [ ] Slightly reduce the left and right padding around the home button on desktop
- [ ] On routes that display a long list of properties (probably greater than 100), I'd like to add something to jump to the right part of the list, similar to what we did with architects.  Grouping jumping to street name is a logical way to do this., but I'm curious what you might suggest to implement.  The routes where this is a problem is #district/Ridge%20Historic%20District and #district/Brainerd%20Bungalow%20Historic%20District.  I know the list is long on #survey/color/Orange, but it doesn't really bother me there and I don't think you need to add anythign to that route.
- [ ] I continue to see occasions where I'm on the # route and zoom in on the map (either zoom or by touching on a building), then somewhat quickly tap around on properties and after a few taps, if I accidentally tap outside a building, the map suddenly zooms all the way out.  This only appears to be happening on the # route.  This happens on both desktop and mobile.  Also of note, I continue to see Mac Safari freezing, I think often on this case.  I don't want you to try to fix the freezing yet, but I think it might be related thought it might be a separate issue  I don't want you to make massive changes to logic to fix this yet because I want to understand any major complex changes you make to filtering, prefetching, etc. before you make them.
- [ ] On mobile when I hover over the ribbon icon on the #property route, the hover effect shows up to the left and half of it it cutoff the screen.  fix this.
- [ ] When on the # route and I tap on a building, the map zooms in close and shows the property, but it seems to hide all the district layers.  I still want the district layers visible.
- [ ] In the blue "Getting Started" box, can you add an address search bar (in the same style as the existing property search box).  Use the same autocomplete functionality as the property search box.  When the user selects a property, go to #property and show the property the user selected.  Also, on mobile below this new search box, can you add the text "Or navigate with these pill bars at the top of the screen:".  Just below this text, reproduce the pill bars, excluding the home button.
- [ ]  On the #landmarks route, add a grey uppercase title (similar to the title on the #district route) above the current properties listed that says "Chicago Landmarks" 
- [ ] On the #landmarks route, add a new grouping of properties below the Chicago Landmarks grouping.  Title for it should be "Contributing Properties to Ridge Historic District".  Under it, list the properties in the Ridge Historic District with contributing_ridge_historic_district set to Y.
- [ ] On the #landmarks route, add a higlight icon next to the headings of the groupings, which will highlight all the properties in the group on the map.
